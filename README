Frappy
======

Frappy is a framework for interacting with social web APIs.  It is meant to be
an easy/quick way to create small Python wrappers for web APIs.

History
=======

Frappy was started by using The Minimalist Twitter API for Python.  This
project did a great job of making a small and easy to use wrapper for the
Twitter API.  However, the majority of the code was very generic, and was very
easy to extend to other web APIs.

Supported APIs
==============

* Twitter

Contribution Guidelines
=======================

* All code should be PEP8 compliant.
* Try running pylint on your changes and minimize the errors/warnings.  Ideally
  all code should be rated at least 7.0 by pylint.
